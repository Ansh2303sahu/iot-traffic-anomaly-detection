🧪 Feature Engineering

The project evaluates model performance using different feature groups, including:

Basic Network Features

Ports, protocols, services

Packet and byte-level statistics

Statistical Traffic Features

Extended traffic behavior metrics

Connection-level statistics

This enables effective comparison of models under different feature representations.

🚀 Workflow

Data Ingestion
Network traffic logs are loaded from scenario-based datasets.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical attributes

Scaling numerical features

Model Training
Multiple ML models are trained using standardized pipelines.

Evaluation & Comparison
Model performance is evaluated and saved for comparison.
